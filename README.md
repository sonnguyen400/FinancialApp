## Configuration

Editing `application.properties` located in `/src/main/resource/application.properties` can allow you to configure some properties. You then can read values inside by using annotation @Value 

```java
//Example
// Annotation in com.sonnguyen.individual.nhs.context
@Value(name="com.data.mysql.driver")
private String driver;
```

# Function Explanation
## Loan Policy
### Create Loan

In Loan creation page, the customer must enter some information including:
- Disbursement Account Number (Beneficiary Account). Account received money once loan is approved
- Term 
- Amount (Limitation depends on customer's Membership)

### Approve Loan
After clients create their loan. Admin can approve or reject them.

If loan is approved, there will be a transaction transferring money from the branch account to the Beneficiary Account based on information provided by the user before.

If loan is rejected, there will 

### Loan Payment

Customers will be notified before 3 days before payment day. This is one of scheduler duty automatically operating at 3AM every days
Formula:
MonthlyPayment= ( initialAmount * interestRate / term ) + ( initialAmount / term) + (( initialAmount * interestRate / term ) + ( initialAmount / term ))*(latepaymentmonth)*percentfines

## Savings Policy

### Create Savings 

- Source Account: Money will be transferred from this account to new savings account.
- Type: Only support term deposit
- Term: Select term 
- Rollover: Select rollover
- Beneficiary Account: Up to your selected rollover type, money will automatically be transferred to this account.

_**A savings can be early finished than expected if customers want to. Aware it is a term deposit. Customers can't receive any profit if they finish savings before the date**_

### Rollover

Rollover is executed automatically by scheduler. In the worst case of the absence of any incident, customer may have to withdraw all money from the savings account manually.

## Scheduler Service

Powered by apache deltaspike module. Time can be changed by editing [cronExpression](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html).
All schedulers put in scheduler package
- Savings Rollover Scheduler
- Loan Payment Warning Scheduler

## Security
### Authentication Mechanism
Security Service include three primary [SecurityContextHolder](), [UserDetailService]() ,[UserDetail Interface](), [PasswordEncoder]()
#### UserDetail Interface
Providing implementation of methods:
- getUsername() returns name of authorized object
- getPassword() returns password of authorized object
- getAuthorities() return roles or authorities of authorized object

#### UserDetailService
Its duty is to retrieve user information from database to get  UserDetail through Username

#### SecurityContextHolder
SecurityContextHolder encompasses authorized object (implemented from UserDetail) and authenticate method.

The "authenticate" method receives a parameter implemented from UserDetail Interface.

The mechanism behind authenticating is relatively simple. It will compare the password obtained from the argument and the password from User got from  UserDetailService implementation.

If the Implementation of UserDetailService doesn't find any user from and username or the passwords don't match, it will throw an AuthenticationException.

### PasswordEncoder
Every Password encoder must be implemented from interface com.sonnguyen.individual.nhs.security.core.PasswordEncoder and annotated as @Model make it can be managed by CDI.

NoPasswordEncoder will be used if CDI doesn't find any appropriate PasswordEncoder.

In this project, I'm using Argon as the default PasswordEncoder.

### Two-Factor Authentication {2FA}
#### OTP

OTP sent via Email or can be observed by console (<span style="color: greenyellow">application.debug=true</span>)

#### PIN

6-digit in length. 

Store in database alongside login data.
